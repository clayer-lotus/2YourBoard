              <br> <br>
              STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
              <br> <br>
              Background:
              We started the business over 12 years ago when we identified a demand in Hong Kong for premium greetings cards – we are now the leading distributor of greetings cards company in Hong Kong.
              We have exclusive distribution agreements with the UK’s leading greetings card suppliers
              Our USPs are our buying expertise, understanding of the market and unrivalled customer service including merchandising and delivery turnaround times – a capability supported by our efficient, well-organised logistics team
              We distribute in over 150 retail stores in Hong Kong including supermarkets, book store chains and independents.
              Note: Kellie and her business partner are both based in the UK; Kellie moved back permanently a year ago). There is a small operational team on the ground in HK but recently two longstanding employees here have resigned, further increasing business risk
              <br> <br>
              The business consists of 8 full time staff ( 2 in UK the rest in HK) 4 part time staff ( 1 in the UK)

               <p style="font-weight:400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;" tabindex="0">With the loss of 2 long-standing members of your team and not being on the ground to personally manage your business, I appreciate your concern in expediting a sale. You are also correct that the continuing restrictions for travel to Hong Kong makes any on-the-ground due diligence very difficult. Whilst not ideal, I would strongly recommend that you and your business partner alternate getting back to HK to oversee the business on short business trips, appreciating the continued one week quarantine – to mitigate the risk of a negative change in trajectory at the critical time of a sale. It would be a tragedy not to capitalise on the monetary value of a successful 12-year business because of a decline, at the point of sale.</p><p style="font-weight:400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">That aside, let me give you a summary cheat sheet of what you can do to prepare your business for a sale:</p><ol><li>Commence with a strategic plan for a sale. This creates a wide thought process amongst your key stakeholders, and discuss items like 'whether you want the sale to be kept confidential or open'; and discuss the implications to staff motivation and retention; the impact on vendors, suppliers and any other interested parties, etc. A corporate sale takes time, and not keeping this close, can cause a lot of uncertainty that can have (a) uncertainty amongst key stakeholders in your business; and (b) potentially negatively impact your price point if it has created a negative outcome.</li><li>Do some internal due diligence of your own. You have been trading for 12 years and unless you have been exceptional in keeping everything completely up to date, a detailed review with a lens that your ultimate buyer will have when completing their own due diligence is critical. It will allow you to identify and clean up all sorts of things and you mayl find surprises that mayimpact the sales price; or force you to issues indemnities until the issues are fixed.</li><li>Think through how you want to structure a sale. Deferred payment, equity stake, cash payment - each will have different tax considerations in the UK and in HK; and it may be worthwhile contacting your tax accountant and have them take you through the options and implications of each option.</li><li>Get an independent financial Accountant to give you a valuation on your company. This gives you a baseline number.</li><li>You can start to look at potential buyers. Two options at this point: find a corporate finance firm that will assist you in identifying potential buyers and help you with pitch book, Agreements and price negotiation, etc., but there will be a material cost to this. The other option, is to do some of this yourselves. I would suggest perhaps starting with this approach, and if you exhaust avenues, the corporate finance option is always available to you. An obvious start is local and international competitors; suppliers; vendors; specific customers; private equity firms; look internationally as to who would benefit from the company and product you have created.</li><li>At the the point you have an interested party, you will need to engage a lawyer as there will be pre-sales agreements to finalise, including NDAs if you want to keep the sale confidential.</li><li>The potential Buyer is going to conduct detailed Due Diligence to ensure that they are paying the right price.</li><li>If this goes well and you have agreed on a price and how to structure the deal, you move to the Completion Agreement. This is self explanatory, and not much different to selling a house. All the terms will be detailedIn principal, whilst you are now done, there are a number of post-acquisition items need to be agreed, and a lot will hinge on whether you are selling the business turn key or just selling the assets, IP and good will - and these typically pivot around your people. You need to agree how that needs to be managed in your strategic plan and ensure this is negotiated and discussed in any pitch book and pre-sales negotiations.</li></ol><p style="font-weight:400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">YourBoard can help you with a lot of the above-mentioned. Where we believe we can add value are in the following areas:</p><p style="font-weight:400;" data-mce-style="font-weight: 400;">Assist in putting a Strategic Plan in place; creating a 'project' list of what to cover in the pre-due diligence phase; possibly find a Corporate Finance expert in this area; assist putting together a one-pager and more detailed pitch book; contribute to the process of thinking through potential buyers by sector (not necessarily securing one); review legal agreements; assist in any post acquisition strategy concerning people or any specific aspects you want / need negotiated into the sale.</p>

            <p tabindex="0">You appear to have cornered a niche market in HK. Congratulations!</p><p>As Franck has set out there's a financial case to be made to any potential buyer. I will point to another aspect of the sale which will focus on why you are selling, whether there is a business if you are not part of it, and whether there is sufficient demand for greeting cards in the coming years as digital e-cards strengthen in popularity and analysts see the greeting card business having negative CAGR over the coming years in China and globally.</p><p>Strategizing the best position to convince potential buyers will not be straight forward and needs advance planning (areas where YourBoard can help) to test assumptions, make the case and plan answers for the questions that will come -- and then rehearse, rehearse, rehearse!</p><p>As a potential investor, I would also be concerned about the staff turnover, particularly without the Principals in place in Hong Kong to protect their business. You might want to consider what additional incentives you can give at this time to keep your employees in place...it may well be worth the effort and additional cost if it keeps the business in shape. Otherwise, an investor can easily decide to sit on the sidelines for a few months to watch for evidence of any potential implosion in the business.</p>

It can take time - and even when an agreement is made, transactions can take longer than expected.<br>Below some thoughts with an emphasis on Marketing and Customer Experience</p><p>It has been mentioned the importance of a 'Pitch Book' and this is really key. <br>In addition to the functional business aspects, it should include some of your story and what makes your business unique, successful, and sustainable into the future.&nbsp;<br>Being clear on what the purchaser is buying in order of business value will be very important - is it the distribution network, the in-house process, or the product provided?&nbsp;</p><p>The message has to be how the key USP elements highlighted as reasons for success&nbsp;will be sustainable without you being there to maintain them along with the relationships and the services standards (the potential buyers&nbsp;will be looking for 'a going concern')<br>With some staffing transition at present, this would be a great opportunity to indicate how sustainable the business is and has been during the recent period.<br>Highlighting the projections for future sales and demand for the greeting card market, your USPs and where you see the future opportunities (i.e. diversification into other related areas) and where the industry is heading overall (how much impact to date of e-greeting cards?)&nbsp;<br>A consideration will be who you are targeting as potential buyers as raised by Franck. Based on who is most likely can help define the marketing of the sales&nbsp;</p><p><strong class="text-bold">From a Marketing Perspective</strong><br>Per above, the marketing of the proposed sale is ideally directed to those most likely to purchase, which you will need to consider and determine.&nbsp;Also, is it going to be a primary business for the new owner, or could it be a complimentary secondary one for a business in a similar field?<br>If for multiple targets,&nbsp;consider the terminology used and how this need to flex.</p><p><strong class="text-bold">From a Customer experience perspective</strong><br>One of the USPs highlighted is the unrivalled customer service including merchandising and turnaround times (ensure evidence of this vs competitors is&nbsp;available).<br>A critical aspect is how well ingrained this is in your processes and business that it enables it to sustain under a different owner. Will you be around for a transition period, or are you considering a 'clean hands' full departure approach?</p><p><strong class="text-bold">Key&nbsp;Conclusion</strong><br>&nbsp;- Identify what is is exactly that makes your business successful and unique, and why this will continue without you there driving it.<br>&nbsp;- Consider who the potential buyers could be, and develop your 'pitch book' based on these two aspects.<br>&nbsp;- Include past performance (financial&nbsp;facts), USPs and proposition aspects that differentiate, with evidence where available (non-financial&nbsp;facts), and future prospects and opportunities (both non-financial and financial outlooks)<br>&nbsp;- Determine who can help you who will really represent you appropriately and can understand the process you are going through vs as a pure transactional approach.<br>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Consider what you would like to receive as a purchase price in a base case, best case, and worst case scenario so you have a range and can be as objective as possible on the price.<br>&nbsp;- Have a target timeline and a plan B if the if that timeline is reached.<br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>

            <p tabindex="0">I found myself in a very similar situation as yourselves. I had a successful business that I wished to sell a few years ago, and struggled to find a company like YourBoard to assist me, and had to jump through all the hoops on my own. I have detailed below from my own personal experience, some of the most critical factors to be aware of and take into account.</p><ul class="gmail-ul1"><li class="gmail-li1"><strong class="text-bold">Business valuation</strong> by an official appraiser is essential. As business owners, we tend to undervalue or over value our business. Having sold my multinational in 2018, we took EBIT x 7 years as a starting point. This was what we used in the printing and packaging industry and the final selling price was not far from it.</li></ul><p>If your sales turnover is HKD10m, your EBIT is 12%, your valuation would be<br>7 x 10,000,000 x 0.12= HKD8,400,000</p><p>* <strong class="text-bold">A one-page market ‘teaser’</strong> and ultimately a detailed pitch book, is important to create, especially with key financial data, including:<br>Turnover,<br>GP,<br>EBITDA,<br>Staffing<br>number of clients.<br></p><p>It is critical that anyone empowered to talk about the Sale in your company is completely fluent in your presentation. If necessary, invest in training to perfect the pitch. You will need it to be perfect when in front of potential buyers. YourBoard can help with this if required. Your 'ElevatorPitch' needs to be perfected.</p><p>* <u class="text-underline"><strong class="text-bold">Potential Buyers could be:</strong></u><br>-&gt; <strong class="text-bold">Management</strong> - If the plan is to add executives to replace the owners in the day to day business operations, why not suggest selling Business to them as an option?<br>This French retail promotion company <a href="https://www.promotionlh.fr/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" tabindex="-1"><span class="gmail-s1">https://www.promotionlh.fr/</span></a> was sold this way in 2009 to an executive coming from the perishable industry hired a year before with such an option.Business owner was getting old and wanted out. Though very connected in the Lyon area, he was not able to get any interest.</p><p>12 years later, sales tripled and the previous owner sold at a very lucrative price.<br>Potential buyers could be a few or all existing employees.<br></p><p>-&gt; <strong class="text-bold">Suppliers</strong> - looking into expanding in the industry and entering a new market.<br>It could also be one of the printers producing for your existing brands. I am thinking about Hung Hing, Starlight, C&amp;C Offset and the likes<br><br>-&gt; <strong class="text-bold">Competitors</strong> - not present in your market in search of growing market shares<br><br>-&gt; <strong class="text-bold">Migrating families</strong> in view of the current expat leaving Hk in mass, a new expat community probably from less fortunate countries. They might be looking for the opportunity to buy your firm and get a visa in HK for their whole family. <br>My previous partner was based in Shanghai. When we sold the business, she bought a convenience store chain in Australia so that she and her family could obtain a visa to live there. In the US, outside of large cities, it is common to see small hotel chains like Best Western, Ramada and the likes to be run and managed by Indians. In order to migrate to the US and get a visa (E2 - investor visa), they need to buy a business in the US of a certain value. Building awareness about House of Cards to them could bring solid opportunities.<br></p><p>* <strong class="text-bold">Brokers</strong> - are most of the time a waste of time and require a lot of paperwork:<br>A broker takes on average 8 to 10% fee and I was reading a study not too long ago that over 90% of businesses listed by brokers never find a buyer. So using them might be irrelevant and a waste of time. However banks could bring very interesting leads. Banks finance all sorts of projects in all industries.</p><p><u class="text-underline"><strong class="text-bold">Other considerations include:</strong></u><br></p><ul class="gmail-ul1"><li class="gmail-li1"><strong class="text-bold">Docs must be ready</strong><br>Financial statements, tax returns dating back three to four years, a list of equipment that's being sold with the business, a list of contacts related to sales transactions and supplies, and dig up any relevant paperwork such as your current lease. Create copies of these documents to distribute to financially qualified potential buyers.<br><br>* <strong class="text-bold">Discussions expose you to risks</strong><br>-&gt; Due diligence will reveal all about your business to the potential buyer, this is why it is essential to:<br>- agree on a non refundable retainer in case the potential buyer backs out<br>- put in place a solid NDA that applies to the company, all its staff and affiliates (lawyer, auditor, vendors…)</li></ul><p>-&gt; Some acquisitions not only require the sellers to stay in the company for a fixed period of time, but also make the payment in stages.<br>The Purpose is to ensure the sellers do not start the same business the next and take all business with them.<br></p>
